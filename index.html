            <p class="home-bio">My name is Aleksi Hieta. I aim to make an impact on the world
            through engineering. This site shows the projects I have contributed
            to along with some of my experience. At Oregon State University I have
            nearly completed my Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering 
            with a minor in Computer Science. I anticipate graduation in June, yet in 
            the meantime I am a full time employee at Collins Aerospace of Raytheon 
            Technologies in Wilsonville, OR. Please feel free to explore some of the 
            pages below to see documentation and other achievements.
